# Handwriting Recognition Analysis #

I'm working on a project that can quickly find relavant code on a Github repository based on a software engineer's whiteboard session.

In order to do this, I need to create a Machine Learning Model that can take images of writing and turn it into text. I have created a script that can do this for me using the [Google Cloud Vision API](https://cloud.google.com/vision/) and stored it here. 

The requirements were that it can be easily plugged into a Flask app and called from a responsive website, which has been proven to work here.

# Handwriting Recognition Analysis #

For my Intro to Software Engineering Class at the University of Waterloo, I'm working on a project that can quickly find the most efficient function to complete any programming task based on writing done during whiteboarding sessions. 

In order to do this, I need to create a Machine Learning Model that can take images of writing and turn it into text. This repository is designed for me to be able to explore my options and find the most optimum one.

This problem is essentially the standard handwriting recognition with MNIST most people start off with but with more complexity. Instead of the input being single characters, it will be multiple. Additionally, there are many more possible digits beyond 1-9, as the alphabet will exist.

A robust system which I believe can complete this task has been documented in the following paper:
Chammas, Edgard & Mokbel, Chafic & Likforman-Sulem, Laurence. (2018). Handwriting Recognition of Historical Documents with Few Labeled Data. 43-48. 10.1109/DAS.2018.15.
